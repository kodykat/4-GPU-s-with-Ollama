DO NOT RUN OLLAMA WHILE CONFIGURING THESE SETTINGS. 

On RepoCloud.io, change the environment variable which is CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.
To do that, we can check what graphics card you have, and most importantly if it is compatible with Ollama + Repocloud.io.

USE THESE LINKS TO SEE IF YOUR GPU IS CAPABLE.

AMD: https://ollama.com/blog/amd-preview 
Nvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus 

If its capable and supported, you can continue.

On the terminal, type in ‘[insertgputype]-smi -L’
ex. nvidia-smi  -L 
 
This will list out the GPU’s and their indexes that are available in a format similar to this.
 

Now, we can set the environment variable using this command:
‘export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=(whichever index)’ 
ex. expord CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1

You mentioned 4 GPUs.. I believe it should allow you to select any variable from 1-4. If you want to do more than one I would try
‘export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES [and the numbers that the command above gave your GPUS followed by commas]’
example: export cuda_visible_devices=0,2 or 4,2 etc. It may even allow you to add all of them. 

After the export, relaunch Ollama and now it should work using your selected GPU’s.
